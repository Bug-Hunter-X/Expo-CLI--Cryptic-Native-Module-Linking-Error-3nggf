The solution involves a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the native module linking issue:

1. **Clean the project:** Remove the node_modules folder and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Check native dependencies:** Ensure all native dependencies are correctly installed and listed in the package.json and app.json file.
3. **Verify Expo SDK version:** Make sure you are using a compatible Expo SDK version with your native dependencies.  Consider checking the release notes for any relevant compatibility issues.
4. **Check build settings:** Review your project's build settings (e.g., `ios/Podfile`, `android/build.gradle`) for any potential inconsistencies or misconfigurations.
5. **Clear the Expo cache:** Delete the Expo cache directory to remove any potentially corrupted build artifacts.  The location of this directory might vary slightly between operating systems.
6. **Eject from Expo (if necessary):**  As a last resort, consider ejecting from Expo (using `expo prebuild` and then continuing the process manually) to gain more direct control over the native build process. 
7. **Examine logs carefully:** While the initial error message might be vague, examine the full build logs for more detailed clues about what went wrong.  Specific error messages deep within the logs may give a better idea about which module or library is causing the problems.
